# Pending Technical Blog Engine

Created for the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I'm aiming to;

- Build a basic blog engine
- Host it in AWS

Along the way I want to;

- Get familiar at a high level with AWS Hosting for the site
- Get familiar with TypeScript at a proficient level
- Get better with my CSS (specifically layouts), and general design ability
